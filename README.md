### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I've learned to do all the general styling and CSS while watching how Kevin Powell did his one. I've attempted once by my one self but got stuck at some styling point because I didn't organize things up as how it would make my work easier. Special thanks to him for his help and tips on HTML and CSS.
